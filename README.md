## 🌱 How to start this project

Follow the instructions below:

1. Create a new repository by forking the [Git project](https://github.com/4geeksacademy/web-scraping-project-tutorial) or [by clicking here](https://github.com/4geeksacademy/web-scraping-project-tutorial/fork).
2. Open the newly created repository in Codespace using the [Codespace button extension](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository).
3. Once the Codespace VSCode has finished opening, start your project by following the instructions below.

## 🚛 How to deliver this project

Once you have finished solving the exercises, be sure to commit your changes, push them to your repository, and go to 4Geeks.com to upload the repository link.

## 📝 Instructions

Read the contents of the `./INSTRUCTIONS.md` file containing the steps to complete the project, follow them and develop the solution first in `./src/explore.ipynb` for testing and then move the clean code to `./src/app.py`. Be sure to delete the notebook once you no longer need it to keep the project clean and tidy.

> Note: We also incorporated the solution samples on ./src/solution.ipynb that we strongly suggest you only use if you are stuck for more than 30 min or if you have already finished and want to compare it with your approach.
